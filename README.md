# Introduction:
- Hello, it's Minh Vu
- The aim of the project is to create a fully functional Operating System that has the interface mimicking Window 10 using mainly Typescript language, React, and NextJS framework.
- This project is largely inspired by [JSLinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/) created by Fabrice Bellard and [daedalOS](https://dustinbrett.com/) created by Dustin Brett.

# Progress:
- We are fastfowarding to creating the file system, resizing windows, and creating real application inside the web-interface

# Credibility:
- My project is largely follow the guides and documentation through Dustin Brett's youtube videos. You can check out his Youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DustinBrett)


<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
